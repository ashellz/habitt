Things to fix:

4. Hide categories with no habits
5. Change the way animations work

Fixed things:

1. When a new habit is created, open the category it's created in
2. When a new habit is created, if the category is opened, update the height of the category
3. When a habit is edited to be in another category, update both categories heights (firstCategoryHeight -= 71, secondCategoryHeight += 71)
4. Habit name going into the second row
5. Apply 1 second delay to every category open and close
