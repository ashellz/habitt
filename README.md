# habitt

My first ever flutter project, actually ended up being a decent minimalist app I used myself for a couple months.
Stopped working on it since last year so I might as well open source it.

Feel free to download the code (it sucks, it's bad, it's unoptimized, may crash). Don't say I didn't warn you.

This is the project I started learning flutter on and it was basically a jumpad for me for other flutter projects.

The idea is great, but optimizing the code and making it work properly failed.

Habit 2.0 in process...
